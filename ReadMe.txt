This is My Fifth Project with Udacity,
And the first under a New NanoDegree in ML.
In this project, I was to choose among a few Supervised Learning models, find out which is the best,
and train it on a data set.
The project-flow is as follows:
-Clean the Dataset a bit, scale the features to make training more effective
Also, learn about the Dataset a bit.

-Use a Naive Predictor(assumption about False Negatives and True Negatives being zero), and test it. Keep this as a reference

-Take 3 of 6, evaluate the three chosen (without optimising)

-Choose the one that one felt would be the best model (I chose the Random Forest Classifier)

-Describe the model in Layman Terms

-Find the best set of parameters using GridSearch CV, and train the model

-Test the model after optimizing

-Let the AdaBoost Classifier (an ensemble method) figure out select features, 
which may allow the model to set its focus more on the important ones

-Test the model using those select features, and see if its any better

Thats about how the project goes.
Hope you like it!
